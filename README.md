# CamShow
Simple, clean webcam viewer application, targeted at anyone wanting to use a webcam as a document camera/visualiser.

## Using this code ##
This is a C# Visual Studio project, so you'll need something that can handle Visual Studio projects, which you can get for free from https://www.visualstudio.com.

It is written for the Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), targetting .net and relies on the AForge.net library.

## Using the application ##
1. Connect your webcam, ensuring you have any required drivers installed.
2. Start CamShow
3. If required, select your desired webcam from the first combobox.
4. Again, only if required, change the resolution (mainly if your computer can't handle the video fast enough to keep up).
5. If you need to, tick the box marked "Flip Image", to re-orient the image to appear the right way up.

If you want to keep the current image up on the screen whilst you set up the next document, just hit the pause button, or press the spacebar. Press either again to un-pause.
To make the most of your projector, you'll probably want to go fullscreen, so hit the fullscreen button!
You can hide the toolbar if it is in the way by pressing the down arrow button.
If the image is too dark or too light, hit the options button (three horizontal lines), to bring up the camera's configuration page. Especially useful is to increase contrast when showing printed text material.
